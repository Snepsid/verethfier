/**
 * VerificationRule interface
 * 
 * Represents a verification rule in the rule-based verification system.
 * Rules define criteria that users must meet to receive specific Discord roles.
 * 
 * Rules support flexible matching including:
 * - Collection-specific or all collections (slug)
 * - Channel-specific or server-wide application (channel_id)
 * - Attribute-based filtering (attribute_key/attribute_value)
 * - Minimum quantity requirements (min_items)
 * 
 * This is a flexible partial interface that supports both complete rule objects
 * from the database and temporary rule objects used during matching operations.
