 * AppService
 *

 * for the Verethfier Discord bot backend. This service is primarily used for
 * application lifecycle management and basic health monitoring.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Application health checks and status reporting
 * - Basic service coordination and initialization
 * - Environment configuration validation
 * - System-wide utility functions
 * 
 * The service is intentionally lightweight, with most business logic
 * delegated to specialized services (verification, Discord, data access, etc.).
