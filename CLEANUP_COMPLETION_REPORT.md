# Backend Cleanup Completion Report

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Overview
Successfully completed the backend audit, cleanup, and security improvements for the Verethfier project.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Test Coverage & Quality Improvements
- **Achieved 83%+ overall test coverage** with 275 passing tests
- **Rewrote and expanded test suites** for core services (data, db, discord)
- **Fixed Supabase mocking** and Discord API test coverage
- **Enhanced error handling tests** including Discord bot error scenarios
- **All tests passing** with clean output

### 2. Package Manager Standardization
- **Standardized on yarn** for both frontend and backend
- **Removed all `package-lock.json` files** from the project
- **Verified builds work** with yarn for both environments
- **Created `PACKAGE_MANAGER.md`** documentation

### 3. Security Audit & Improvements
- **Fixed CORS misconfiguration** with strict allowlist
- **Added Helmet security headers** for protection
- **Implemented global ValidationPipe** for input validation
- **Added rate limiting** with ThrottlerModule
- **Updated error handling** to prevent information disclosure
- **Fixed dependency vulnerabilities** through updates
- **Documented findings** in `SECURITY_AUDIT.md`

### 4. Wallet Verification Flow Debug
- **Identified DTO validation issue** blocking valid requests
- **Updated DTOs** for proper wallet signature validation
- **Verified end-to-end wallet verification** works correctly

### 5. Code Cleanup & Dependencies
- **Removed unused dependencies**: `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, `passport-discord`, `passport-local`, and related dev dependencies
- **Cleaned up legacy test files**: removed JS test files and backup files
- **Removed redundant dotenv imports** from all service files
- **Consolidated environment configuration** to `main.ts`
- **Removed unused environment variables** (`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- **Removed commented code** (HttpModule import)

### 6. Project Structure Improvements
- **Created automated cleanup script** (`cleanup.sh`)
- **Improved error logging** throughout the application
- **Enhanced DTO validation** with proper decorators
- **Optimized imports** and removed redundancies

## ðŸ”§ Final State
