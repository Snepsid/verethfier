## 🔧 **Configuration Changes Required**

### **Environment Variables**
All existing environment variables continue to work. Optional additions:
```env
# Optional: Frontend URL for CORS (defaults to localhost:4200)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4200

# Optional: Cache TTL overrides (uses sensible defaults)
CACHE_TTL_RULES=300
CACHE_TTL_ASSETS=120
```

### **Development vs Production**
- **Development**: Full logging, detailed debugging, cache monitoring
- **Production**: Error/warn logging only, optimized performance, security headers

## 🧪 **Validation Results**

- ✅ **All TypeScript compilation**: No errors
- ✅ **All tests passing**: 32/32 tests in DataService
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: All existing APIs work unchanged
- ✅ **Performance improvements**: Measured in query execution times

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Further Optimization**

### **Short Term (Optional)**
1. **Redis Integration**: Replace in-memory cache with Redis for distributed caching
2. **Database Indexing**: Review slow query logs and add targeted indexes
3. **API Response Caching**: Cache entire API responses for read-heavy endpoints

### **Medium Term (Optional)**
1. **Connection Pooling**: Implement custom connection pooling for database operations
2. **Background Job Processing**: Move heavy operations to background queues
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: Implement performance metrics collection and visualization

### **Long Term (Optional)**
